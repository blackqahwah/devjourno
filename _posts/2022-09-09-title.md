# Back in the trenches.



*Mark Zuckerberg referred to doing gruelling work as being **‚Äúin the trenches‚Äù.***

*..ends the battle of who gets to find the trenches relatable and who doesn‚Äôt.*

## So, I've decided to give this thing a try. :checkered_flag:

The thing where I randomly put an `API/SDK` to work and talk about it.

Starting with the [Adobe PDF SDK](https://github.com/adobe/pdfservices-node-sdk-samples#readme).



## Back story :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

I want the one true pdf reader for me.

I tend to have about 15 CRs (current reads) and no tools to ensure that ***reading is equally distributed*** across all CRs. 

***So why not build one?***	:hammer_and_wrench:




I decided to check out the Adobe Pdf Sdk and let‚Äôs just say, _baby steps won‚Äôt hurt, eh?_

The API is **server side** rendered and *I don‚Äôt know node js*. 

Makes it even more interesting. 




## I dive in :diving_mask:

I **cloned the repo** and went straight to _READ ME._ 

Quite instructive.

I had to obtain **credentials** before running any samples. 


**The credentials last six months.**

:eyes:  ‚Ä¶ I mean, I  was about to carry on with my business until...  **_Logging?_**

- no idea what it meant and could go no further until I'd at least a primer on it. 

- after a bit of scrolling, I found a near perfect [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/you-should-have-better-logging-now-fbab2f667fac/) that helped.

- it gave more meaning to an [unrelated](https://twitter.com/solibayo/status/1553700578236272642) twitter back and forth that occurred a while back.



### Now I'll get back go cooking. :woman_cook:
