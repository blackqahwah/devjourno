i toured the `HTML-PDF` API, 
and i'm thankful for journey mercies. 😮‍💨

## now ✋

i thought we were dealing with only one HTML file here?

so there's the HTML file (to be converted), and there's the `source HTML file`?

_why?_

and why does it have to be created from a local file ⤵️?

## i asked google..the wrong question👍

_and got a mumbo-jumbo of search keywords for answers_

## two days later ⏳💡
i was sub-consciously bad mouthing `js` when i imagined that the samples in `java`, for example, might be less chinesey..

i headed there and while the syntax was barely different, **_it instantly clicked!_** 🤦‍♀️

_`java sample`_

the keyword i'd been missing? ➡️ `file-ref` ⬅️

_it was there the whooolee timeeeee_

it should've been a no brainer, _but here we are_

**_in plain english_ ⤵️**

> `data` from the HTML file (to be converted) is initially sent to ➡️ _a temporary location created solely for that purpose_
> 
>  **_aka_** `source HTML file`.

>  
>  when we call `save eesh`, the data heads down to the ➡️ `destination file` _(now pdf, ready for download or anything else)_
>  
>  finally, delete action is triggered on the `source HTML file`.. _it served its purpose.._

### Now I'll get back go cooking. 👩‍🍳
